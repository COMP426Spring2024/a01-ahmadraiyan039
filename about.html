        <h3>History of Odin</h3>
        <p id = "para1">Odin is a principal god in Norse mythology, which was practiced by the pre-Christian Norse people of Scandinavia. He is considered the chief of the Aesir, one of the two main groups of gods in Norse mythology (the other being the Vanir). Odin is often depicted as a wise and complex figure, associated with wisdom, poetry, death, royalty, and war.</p>
        <p id = "para2">Odin's stories and legends are recorded in various Old Norse texts, including the Poetic Edda and the Prose Edda, which were written in the 13th century but contain much older oral traditions. He remains a prominent figure in modern popular culture, appearing in literature, art, and media inspired by Norse mythology. </p>
